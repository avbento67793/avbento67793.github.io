# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my academic background, technical skills and selected projects.

The portfolio highlights projects developed during my Computer Engineering degree, with a focus on software development, computer networks, artificial intelligence and computer graphics.

## About Me
Final-year Computer Engineering student with strong foundations in software development, algorithms and computer networks. Hands-on experience through academic projects and a strong interest in applying technical knowledge in real-world environments. Currently seeking an internship or entry-level opportunity.

## Featured Projects
- **Object-Oriented Programming – Calendar Management System**
  An object-oriented calendar system developed in Java as part of an academic project.
  The application supports multiple account and event types, using interfaces and clean architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
  Demonstrates strong foundations in object-oriented design and software engineering best practices.

- **Algorithms & Data Structures – Railway Network Management System**
  Command-line railway network management system developed in Java 21.
  Supports dynamic line and schedule management, strict time validation (including overtaking prevention), route optimization, and persistent storage.
  Focused on custom data structures, ADTs, and algorithmic complexity analysis.

- **Computer Networks – Multi-threaded File Transfer System**  
  Client-server application implemented in Python using socket programming and multi-threading.

- **Artificial Intelligence – Simulated Annealing**  
  Implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm to solve an optimization problem using heuristic search techniques.

- **Computer Graphics – 3D Hierarchical Modelling**  
  3D graphics application developed with JavaScript and WebGL, using scene graphs and multiple projection techniques.
